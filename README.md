# A deep learning classifier for Local Ancestry Inference (LAI)

This is the project repository for "A deep learning classifier for local ancestry inference" (ArXiv link forthcoming). Here, you will find descriptions of our reference panel, baseline model (RFMix), and deep learning classifier (SegNet) -- respectively, in the `data`, `baseline`, and `model` subdirectories. 

Additional information on evaluation, including results from a hyperparameter optimization and full test set benchmark, can be found in the `results` foder. Questions about this project can be addressed here on the repository, or sent to Matthew Aguirre (magu) and Alexander Ioannidis (ioannid) -- respective addresses (at stanford dot edu).
