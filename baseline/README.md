# Baseline model

This directory contains the script (`do_rf.sh`) which was used to run RFMix. We used RFMix v2.0.3, which can be installed from [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/rfmix/README.html). 

Note that this script is the pipeline version -- VCFs which resulted from RFMix simulate were passed as command line arguments.
